# Efficient Frontier Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Markowitz Efficient Frontier, which is used to optimize portfolio weights for maximizing the Sharpe ratio or minimizing risk for a given return.

## Code Overview

### Libraries Used

The code makes use of the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `pandas` for handling and manipulating data
- `matplotlib` for plotting the efficient frontier

### Main Steps in the Code

1. **Input Data**:
    - Example daily returns for four assets (`Asset A`, `Asset B`, `Asset C`, and `Asset D`) are provided as a dictionary.
    - This data is converted into a `pandas` DataFrame.

2. **Statistical Calculations**:
    - Calculate mean returns for each asset.
    - Compute the covariance matrix of the asset returns.

3. **Portfolio Simulation**:
    - Generate random portfolio weights to simulate various combinations.
    - Calculate expected return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio for each portfolio.

4. **Optimization**:
    - Identify the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.
    - Plot the efficient frontier using simulated data.

5. **Visualization**:
    - Use `matplotlib` to create a scatter plot of the simulated portfolios, highlighting the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio and the efficient frontier.

### Example Usage

The example included in the code uses synthetic return data for simplicity. You can replace this with your own asset return data to analyze real-world portfolios.

## Key Outputs

1. **Efficient Frontier Plot**:
    - A scatter plot of portfolios showing the risk (standard deviation) vs. return.
    - The efficient frontier is highlighted, along with the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio.

2. **Optimal Portfolio Weights**:
    - The weights for the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio.

## Running the Code

1. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

2. Execute the script:
    ```bash
    python efficient_frontier.py
    ```

3. View the resulting plot and optimal portfolio information in the terminal or output window.

## Customization

- **Input Data**: Replace the example return data with your own historical returns.
- **Risk-Free Rate**: Update the risk-free rate if using the Sharpe ratio for evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Modify the plotting code to include additional information or change the style.
